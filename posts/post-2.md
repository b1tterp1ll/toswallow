I'm glad I made this. Why go to some blog site? Here I can come and just vent. No one will read this. I value my privacy, so just in case someone does stumble onto this, I won't give any details that could identify me. I don't care about your opinion. That's why I built this the way I did. You can comment. You can't get in touch with me to give me your thoughts. I don't want to start a dialog. I just want to vent. This is my place. My slice of the internet. You're not welcome here. If you do want to tell me what you think, tough shit. There is no way to contact me. That's how I like it.
